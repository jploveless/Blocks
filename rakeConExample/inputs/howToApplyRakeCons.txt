To apply segment constraints, use SegmentManager or modify the 12th line (of 13) for segments within segment files. Add the following line to the Command file to specify the constraint weight: 'Rake constraint weight: 1e+10' 
	Examples of rake constrained segments are in './inputs/rakeConExample.segment'

To apply triangular element constraints, use a text document indicating the element index followed by the rake constraint. You must also specify in the Command file 'Type of a priori slip constraint (1 = slip values, 2 = coupling fraction, 3 = rake): 3'
