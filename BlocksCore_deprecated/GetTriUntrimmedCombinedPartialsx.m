% Calculate elastic displacement and/or strain partial derivatives for triangular elements
% 
%   [Gu, Ge, tz] = GetTriCombinedPartials(Patches, Station, option)
%
%   Output arguments:
%   Gu : Displacement partials
%   Ge : Strain partials
%   tz : Zeroing array
%
%   Input arguments:
%   Patches : Patches structure
%   Station : Station structure
%   option : Flag vector indicating which partials should be calculated
%            The first element indicates whether displacement partials should be calculated,
%            and the second whether strain partials should be calculated, using the convention
%            0 = don't calculate, 1 = calculate.
%
%            option can also be an n-by-2 array, with each row corresponding to a row in the 
%            Station structure's fields.  This may cut down on calculation time, only calculating
%            the partials at the specified observation coordinates
